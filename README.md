Smart Rockets - A demonstration of applying genegic algorithm in coding w/ p5.js




## Mechanics of this demo

- Each cycle a population of 100 "Rockets" are spawned, as well as a "Target" represented as a red circle
- Upon spawning, each "Rocket" will randomly generate a set of predetermined 3D vector path
- If "Rockets" hits the canvas edge, it will be considered failed or dead
- After 10 seconds, it will collect the fitness score for each "Rocket"
- Then spawn a new set of 100 "Rocket" that their 3d vector path was mostly based on previous generation score.


## Future Optimizations / TODOs

- Implement slidebar or inputs for the cycle's variables
    - Population Size
    - How long should each cycle last for
    - "Rocket"'s mutation rate
- Improve the current fitness score calculation algorithm
